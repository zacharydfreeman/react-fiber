/**
 * @type
 * @member type - The type of the element. Can be a string (for HTML/SVG tags), a function component (a function that returns a React element), or a class component (a class that extends React.Component and has a render() method).
 * @member props - An object containing the properties passed to the element. These are the properties that are specified in JSX
 * @member key - An optional key that can be used to identify an element in a list. This helps React determine which elements have changed when rendering a list.
 * @member ref - An optional ref that can be used to get a reference to the element's underlying DOM node. This is useful for imperatively manipulating the DOM
 * @member _owner - A reference to the component that created this element. This property is used for debugging purposes only and is not meant to be used in production code.
